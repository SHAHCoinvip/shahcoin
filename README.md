# 🪙 SHAHCOIN CORE (v1.0)

**SHAHCOIN CORE** is a sovereign, next-generation Layer 1 blockchain designed for global adoption, high security, and integrated DeFi utility. It combines as a native, sovereign blockchain, hybrid Proof-of-Stake, and a full decentralized ecosystem — built from the ground up with a focus on real-world usage.
