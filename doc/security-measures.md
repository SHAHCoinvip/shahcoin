# Shahcoin Security Measures & Multi-Algorithm Mining

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive security measures and multi-algorithm mining implementation in Shahcoin, designed to provide robust protection against various attack vectors while maintaining decentralization through algorithm diversity.

## Multi-Algorithm Mining

### Supported Algorithms

Shahcoin implements three mining algorithms with equal weight distribution:

1. **SHA256d** (ALGO_SHA256D = 0)
   - Shahcoin-style double SHA256 hashing
   - ASIC-friendly, high efficiency
   - 33% weight in difficulty adjustment

2. **Scrypt** (ALGO_SCRYPT = 1)
   - Memory-hard algorithm used by SHAHCOIN
   - GPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant
   - 33% weight in difficulty adjustment

3. **Groestl** (ALGO_GROESTL = 2)
   - AES-based hash function
   - CPU/GPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant
   - 34% weight in difficulty adjustment

### Algorithm Rotation

- **Rotation Interval**: 2016 blocks (same as difficulty adjustment)
- **Selection Method**: Round-robin based on block height
- **Formula**: `algorithm = height % 3`

### Block Header Structure

Blocks now include an algorithm field:

```cpp
class CBlockHeader {
    // ... existing fields ...
    uint8_t nAlgorithm; // Multi-algorithm mining support
};
```

### Difficulty Adjustment

Each algorithm maintains separate difficulty tracking:

- **Individual Difficulty**: Each algorithm has its own difficulty target
- **Weighted Adjustment**: Algorithm weights (33%, 33%, 34%) are applied during difficulty calculation
- **Consensus**: All algorithms are accepted equally by the network

### Mining Configuration

Miners can specify their preferred algorithm:

```bash
# Command line
shahcoind -algo=scrypt

# Configuration file
algo=groestl

# SHAHCOIN Core multi-algorithm mining configuration
```
