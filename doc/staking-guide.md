# Shahcoin Staking Guide

## Overview

Shahcoin implements a hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This guide explains how to participate in staking and earn rewards by validating transactions on the Shahcoin network.

## What is Staking?

Staking is a process where you lock up your SHAH coins to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return, you earn staking rewards. Unlike mining, staking doesn't require expensive hardware - you just need SHAH coins and a computer running the Shahcoin wallet.

## Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Minimum Stake Amount**: 333 SHAH
- **Minimum Stake Age**: 24 hours (1,440 blocks)
- **Wallet**: SHAHCOIN Core wallet with staking enabled
- **System**: Any computer that can run SHAHCOIN Core

### Recommended Setup
- **Stake Amount**: 1,000+ SHAH for better chances of earning rewards
- **Uptime**: 24/7 operation for maximum rewards
- **Internet**: Stable internet connection
- **Storage**: At least 10GB free space for blockchain data

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install SHAHCOIN Core

1. Download SHAHCOIN Core from the official website
2. Install and run the wallet
3. Let it sync with the network (this may take several hours)

### Step 2: Enable Staking

1. Open SHAHCOIN Core
2. Go to **Settings** → **Options** → **Staking**
3. Check "Enable staking"
4. Click **OK** and restart the wallet

Alternatively, use the command line:
```bash
shahcoin-cli enablestaking
```

### Step 3: Add Stakes

1. **Get SHAH Coins**: Purchase or mine SHAH coins
2. **Create a Staking Address**: Generate a new address for staking
3. **Add Stake**: Use the RPC command or wallet interface

#### Using RPC Commands:
```bash
# Add a stake of 1000 SHAH
shahcoin-cli addstake "SXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" 1000

# Check your stakes
shahcoin-cli getstakes

# View staking information
shahcoin-cli getstakinginfo
```

#### Using Wallet Interface:
1. Go to **Staking** tab
2. Click **Add Stake**
3. Enter the address and amount
4. Click **Add**

## Staking Mechanics

### How Staking Works

1. **Stake Locking**: Your SHAH coins are locked for staking
2. **Validation**: Your stake participates in block validation
3. **Rewards**: Earn SHAH rewards for successful block creation
4. **Unlocking**: Stakes can be removed after the minimum age

### Block Creation Process

1. **Eligibility Check**: Your stake must meet minimum requirements
2. **Selection**: Higher stakes have better chances of being selected
3. **Block Creation**: If selected, your wallet creates a new block
4. **Reward**: Receive POS_BLOCK_REWARD SHAH for the block

### Hybrid Consensus

Shahcoin alternates between PoW and PoS blocks:
- **Even blocks**: Proof of Work (mining)
- **Odd blocks**: Proof of Stake (staking)

This ensures both mining and staking participants contribute to network security.

## Staking Commands

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Enable staking
shahcoin-cli enablestaking

# Disable staking
shahcoin-cli disablestaking

# Add stake
shahcoin-cli addstake "address" amount

# Remove stake
shahcoin-cli removestake "address"

# Get staking information
shahcoin-cli getstakinginfo

# List your stakes
shahcoin-cli getstakes

# View all network validators
shahcoin-cli getstakevalidators
```

### Advanced Commands

```bash
# Get detailed staking statistics
shahcoin-cli getstakinginfo

# Check stake eligibility
shahcoin-cli getstakes

# Monitor staking performance
shahcoin-cli getstakevalidators
```

## Staking Rewards

### Reward Structure

- **Block Reward**: POS_BLOCK_REWARD SHAH per block
- **Frequency**: Based on stake amount and network difficulty
- **Distribution**: Automatically added to your wallet

### Expected Returns

| Stake Amount | Expected Blocks/Day | Daily Reward |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 333 SHAH     | 0.1               | ~0.1 SHAH    |
| 1,000 SHAH   | 0.3               | ~0.3 SHAH    |
| 5,000 SHAH   | 1.5               | ~1.5 SHAH    |
| 10,000 SHAH  | 3.0               | ~3.0 SHAH    |

*Note: Actual returns may vary based on network conditions*

### Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated based on:
- **Stake Amount**: Higher stakes = more rewards
- **Stake Age**: Older stakes have priority
- **Network Difficulty**: Total network stake affects frequency
- **Uptime**: 24/7 operation maximizes rewards

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Secure Your Wallet**: Use strong passwords and encryption
2. **Backup Regularly**: Keep multiple backups of your wallet
3. **Use Dedicated Address**: Create separate addresses for staking
4. **Monitor Activity**: Regularly check your staking status

### Optimization

1. **Stake Size**: Larger stakes earn more rewards
2. **Uptime**: Keep your wallet running 24/7
3. **Network Connection**: Ensure stable internet connection
4. **System Resources**: Allocate sufficient CPU and memory

### Monitoring

1. **Check Staking Status**: Use `getstakinginfo` regularly
2. **Monitor Rewards**: Track your earnings over time
3. **Network Health**: Stay informed about network updates
4. **Performance**: Optimize your setup based on results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Staking Not Working
```bash
# Check if staking is enabled
shahcoin-cli getstakinginfo

# Verify stake requirements
shahcoin-cli getstakes

# Check wallet balance
shahcoin-cli getbalance
```

#### No Rewards
- Ensure minimum stake amount (333 SHAH)
- Wait for minimum stake age (24 hours)
- Check wallet is running 24/7
- Verify internet connection

#### Low Reward Frequency
- Increase stake amount
- Check network difficulty
- Ensure optimal uptime
- Monitor system performance

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Insufficient balance" | Add more SHAH to wallet |
| "Stake too small" | Increase stake to 333+ SHAH |
| "Stake too young" | Wait 24 hours after adding stake |
| "Staking disabled" | Enable staking in wallet settings |

## Advanced Topics

### Stake Management

```bash
# Update stake amount
shahcoin-cli updatestake "address" new_amount

# Check stake performance
shahcoin-cli getstakinginfo

# Monitor network statistics
shahcoin-cli getstakevalidators
```

### Network Participation

- **Validator Selection**: Higher stakes have better selection chances
- **Block Creation**: Selected validators create new blocks
- **Network Security**: Staking helps secure the network
- **Consensus**: Stakers participate in network consensus

### Economic Considerations

- **Opportunity Cost**: Staked coins cannot be spent
- **Inflation**: Staking rewards increase coin supply
- **Market Impact**: Large stakes can affect network dynamics
- **Risk Management**: Diversify your staking strategy
